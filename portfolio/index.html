                <h4>My Background</h4>
                <p>
                    I have a diverse background that spans communications, web development, and design. Starting as a Communications Officer, I gradually transitioned into frontend development and design, fueled by my love for creativity and technology. I'm currently deepening my expertise through software engineering training at ALX, with additional experience in graphic design, UI/UX, and content writing.

                <h4>My Skills</h4>
                <p>
                    My strengths lie in communication, collaboration, humility, and empathyâ€”qualities that enhance my approach to both teamwork and user-centered design. Technically, Iâ€™m skilled in frontend development, UI/UX, and graphic design, with additional abilities in debugging and coding. I also bring strong secondary skills in problem-solving, research, creative thinking, and adaptability. Iâ€™m currently working on improving my time and energy management, as well as sharpening my attention to detail.

                <h4>My Hobbies</h4>
                <p>
                    Outside of work, I enjoy reading, listening to music, playing games, having deep conversations, and spending time with close friends. I also find that sleeping helps me reset and refocus, making it one of my favorite quirky ways to recharge.
